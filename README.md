#### De Morgan's Law:

#### Pipelining:

#### SRAM vs. DRAM:


#### Caches:

#### LRU and LFU algorithms:
######LRU(Least Recently Used): every block gets a initial counter set to 0, and there is a single global counter also set to 0, for every access the global is incrimented, if what we want is in the cache we set the block counter to the global, else put the block in cache and set to global. when evicting pick the lowest block counter.
######LFU(Least Frequently Used): every block has inital counter set to 1, everytime it is already in cache and accessed ++, when evicting choose the one with the lowest counter, new block rea in gets counter set to 1
