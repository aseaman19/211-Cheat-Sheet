#### De Morgan's Law:

#### Pipelining:using multiple processing stages simultaniously for different instructions to increase instruction throughput. Parallel use of processing stages so noone sits idle. (Laundry example)
####two hazards: 1. data dependencies 2.control dependencies
####Dealing with dependencies: 1. stalling 2. fowarding (data depend.) 3. branch prediction (control flow)

#### SRAM vs. DRAM:
######SRAM:each cell in a 6 transistor circuit retains value indefinetly, faster and more expensive than DRAM,latching technology used here, bistable circuits (2 stable states),faster
######DRAM: cell stores bit with capacitor and transistor, refreshed every 10-100 milliseconds, sensitive to disruptions, has to be recharged, slow

#### Caches:

#### LRU and LFU algorithms:

#### X86 Instructions:

#### Karnaugh Maps:

#### Drawing a Circuit:

#### Locality:

#### Hex Arithmetic:

#### Addressing Modes:

#### Converting C to Assembly:
